ArtRage Tool Version 4!,
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtMMyTeySVIKgYd_...DkPyw?e=cnJOmI
Now I have started to use this tool for painting I have tweaked the following:

» A slider at the bottom of the first tab to set the opacity level on the current selected layer, so no fiddling with the little layer dial!
« A little rearrangement of button positions so that the most common buttons I use are closer to the left hand side

« Selecting the label ArtRage will now strip the tool of its windows header, but of course it will mean that you will not be able to move it, but select the label again and it
comes back!

« Added ticks to brush size slider and label showing the current pixel increment, also the maximum brush increment is now 200 pixels
